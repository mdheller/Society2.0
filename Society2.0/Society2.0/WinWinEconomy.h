//This economy tries to express situations where colaboration is helpful. Usual economy 
//is based on trades. I have this and you have that. This is not always expresses the cases
//where we for example try to strive toward common goal. For example happiness economy really 
//much likes win win situations, it gives money to both parties - because it's win win. Anyway
//This economy build rules in order to better express those situation in some mathematical formulation. 
//Where you can still win more or less and you still have some optimization to benefit the society as 
//a whole. 
//It's obviously better to accept we are ant colony and make some optimization to our hive using math
//Rather than ignore we are this colony, and think we are only individuals while very non scientific 
//Establishments will dictate very badly calibrated huirstics, due to history since the days of anctient greeks. 
//For example democracy is not completelly the best way to solve issues, andswer questions. And even then
//Democracy is only done to establishments once every 4 years, and this is not influencing anything. So the forces
//moving the society are not closing the loop at all they don't care about the people. And this is why we the people
//Need to somewhat more micro manage ourselves but this will be better in the long run, we will catch the liar and 
//psychopats and we will not blame them for being what they are but we will try to find a peacful coexistance without 
//being traumatized as a society from historical psychopats, traumas many of us still beary today.
