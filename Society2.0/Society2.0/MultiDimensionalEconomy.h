//Multi dimensional economy is similiar to trades on graph, but unlike trading with things
//It tries to converge to minimal list of numbers which still can express the multi dimentionality
//of reality and its complexity. Currently we have very complex reality and very linear monetory syste,
//and this creates a lot of complexity. But if we try to reduce reality into "multi dimensional money" 
//like real estate, products, health, entertainment etc. and the flow between the currency will not be 
//So trivial and this will express the complexity of life, and this complexity will be optimized to make 
//People something more which they chose or whatewer (everntually we should live in different cities, and 
//Each city should do whatewer the city does. But they will obviously use this code.
